# Nodejs API | Docker

* This repository serves as a demonstration for a straightforward Node.js project using Docker. It can be utilized by other programmers and cloud platforms like EC2, VRE, and Heroku.

### Installation

1. Install Docker

2. Run the run.bat file
```shell
    ./run.bat
```
3. All set, no need to install nodejs, express and other stuff.

4. Alternately Docker engages the terminal, so if you want to use a single terminal, and perform other action then, comment the last line [in file](./run.bat)

### What is Docker
 - You can see Docker as a way to pack you code in a nice little container that contains everything it needs to run it; it containerizes your code. The benefits are numerous: containers are scalable, cost-effective and are isolated from each other.

### Useful Docker commands
1. List All docker images
    ```shell
        docker images
    ```

2. List All running docker containers
    ```shell
        docker ps
    ```
